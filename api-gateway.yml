      serviceId: echo-service #The name of the service to make the load balancing
      
ribbon: # Eureka interface with Ribbon must be disabled so Ribbon will use the list of servers indicated below
  eureka:

echo-service:
  ribbon:
    listOfServers: http://localhost:8091,http://localhost:8092
    # Above is the list of servers and ports where the different instances of the service is deployed, so Ribbon can use them for load balancing
